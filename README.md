This is a Python repl that can view your ESPN fantasy football team and stats. 
You will need a swid which you can get by going to your fantasy team's website and right-clicking on the page and then pressing inspect then you click on application then cookies and then you can search up swid. 
You will do the same thing for espn_s2. 
You will also need your league id which can be found right here https://fantasy.espn.com/football/team?leagueId=????????? right, where the question marks are.
The password is only available for me so just type something random then you can access your ESPN fantasy football.
